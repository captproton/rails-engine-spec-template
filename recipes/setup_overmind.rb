%{### Starting the Development Environment

First, ensure Overmind is installed:
```bash
brew install overmind
```

To start the development environment with all processes:
```bash
cd spec/dummy
./bin/dev
```

This will start:
- Rails server on port 3000
- Tailwind CSS watcher
- Any other processes defined in `spec/dummy/Procfile.dev`

Overmind commands while running:
- `ctrl-z` to access Overmind's command mode
- In command mode:
  - `r` to restart a process
  - `c` to connect to a process
  - `m` to show process logs
  - `h` for help
  - `q` to quit

}

%{# Development Setup

This is the test application for #{name}. To set up your development environment:

1. Ensure you have Overmind installed:
   ```bash
   brew install overmind
   ```

2. Start the development environment:
   ```bash
   ./bin/dev
   ```

This will start all necessary processes for development.
